Get Started!
------------

Ready to contribute? Here's how to set up `mlbox` for local development.

1. Fork the `mlbox` repo on GitHub.

2. Clone your fork::

    $ git clone git@github.com:your_name_here/mlbox.git

3. If you have virtualenv installed, skip this step. Either, run the following::

    $ pip install virtualenv
    
4. Install your local copy into a virtualenv following this commands to set up your fork for local development::

    $ cd MLBox
    $ virtualenv env
    $ source env/bin/activate
    $ python setup.py develop

If you have any troubles with the setup, please refer to the `installation guide <https://mlbox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html>`__

5. Create a branch for local development::

    $ git checkout -b name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature

**Now you're set, you can make your changes locally.**

NOTE : each time you work on your branch, you will need to activate the virtualenv: ``$ source env/bin/activate``. To deactivate it, simply run: ``$ deactivate``.

6. When you're done making changes, check that your changes pass the tests.

NOTE : you need to install **pytest** before running the tests::

    $ cd tests
    $ pytest

7. Commit your changes and push your branch to GitHub::

    $ git add .
    $ git commit -m "Your detailed description of your changes."
    $ git push origin name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature

8. Submit a pull request through the GitHub website.

Pull Request Guidelines
-----------------------

Before you submit a pull request, check that it meets these guidelines:

1. The pull request should include tests.
2. If the pull request adds functionality, the docs should be updated. Put
   your new functionality into a function with a docstring.
3. The pull request should work for all supported Python versions and for PyPy. Check
   https://travis-ci.org/AxeldeRomblay/MLBox/pull_requests
   and make sure that the tests pass for all supported Python versions.
